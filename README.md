# Object-Tracking
Object Tracking using OpenCV

This is a mini project that I have created to track down objects using the computer webcam.

Packages to install

1.OpenCV

2.OPenCV Contrib #for using the trackers

Working

Its a very simple mechanism by which we select the object in the first frame and give an enter and from the subsequent frames the object will be tracked.
There are variety of trackers, based on the requirement we can choose the required tracker.
